	abstract = {The primary focus of this study by Sprinkle Consulting Engineers, Inc. is to develop a bicycle-quality, or level-of-service, model for applications in U.S. metropolitan areas. Although there are several model forms being used throughout the United States that attempt to quantify road suitability or the quality of service afforded bicyclists traveling the street and roadway networks of urbanized areas, to date there have been no statistically calibrated models published. The statistically calibrated level-of-service model described here is based on real-time perceptions from bicyclists traveling in actual urban traffic and roadway conditions. The study’s participants represented a cross section of age, gender, experience level, and geographic origin of the population of cyclists that use the metropolitan road networks in the United States. The test course is representative of the collector and arterial street systems of North American urban areas. Although further hypothesis testing is being conducted and additional studies are planned to test the need for disaggregate models for central business district streets with high turnover parking, truck routes, and two-lane high-speed rural highways, the general bicycle level-of-service model reported here is highly reliable, has a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.73), and is transferable to the vast majority of United States metropolitan areas. The study reveals that pavement-surface conditions and striping of bicycle lanes are important factors in the quality of service.},

The FHWA BCI can be used by bicycle coordinators, transportation planners, traffic engineers, and others to evaluate existing facilities to determine what improvements may be required, as well as the geometric and operational requirements for new facilities to achieve the desired level of bicycle service.

Thanks to the simplicity of its data needs and interpretation, LTS has been implemented by several states, regions, cities, non-profits, and researchers. However, relatively few validations of the methodology exist. There is a specific gap in relation to safety perceptions for children, an important group since it serves as the critical population for LTS 1. This study validates LTS using a survey of parents in Denver, Colorado, in which they are asked about perceived safety and biking allowance relative to roadway design characteristics. After the LTS score and biking allowance rates for 612 roadway scenarios are determined, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine the suitability of LTS for children. Findings suggest that while LTS 1 and LTS 4 align well with stated preferences, parents told that their children would be able to tolerate some roadway conditions—when allowing for adult supervision—that are currently considered LTS 2 or even LTS 3. These scenarios are primarily on low-volume roadways that have bike lanes. By further refining LTS, it is hoped to ensure that all populations have access to safe and comfortable bicycle facilities.},

	abstract = {Transportation planning in the US has traditionally focused on automotive traffic but is increasingly turning towards a multimodal approach in order to accommodate all users. This shift in focus is particularly crucial for cyclists, as 630 were killed and 51 000 injured on America’s roadways in 2009 alone. Unfortunately, most municipalities do not conduct comprehensive bicycle counts to determine where cyclists are riding, though some do seek a scatter of spot counts. This investigation uses Seattle metropolitan area cyclistcount data from 251 locations to develop a direct-demand model for estimating peakperiod cyclist counts based on trip-generation and attraction factors (such as site-based population and employment densities), as well as cycling-relevant roadway conditions. Roadway-condition variables were chosen from the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (Chapter 17, Transport Research Board, Washington, DC) on urban street segments (including factors like traffic volumes and bike-lane width), as well as other physical features, like bridge presence and access to bicycle trails. Model results show greatest practical significance for intersections within the City of Seattle and curb-lane width (both of which are associated with higher counts) and roadway speed (which is associated with lower counts). The model was implemented in the community of Shoreline, Washington, just north of Seattle, to demonstrate its applicability. We examined both segment-based levels of service for cyclists and expected intersection-based counts. Model application findings indicate that segment-based levels of service show little correlation with expected counts, though such information still serves a valuable purpose in terms of evaluating cyclists’ comfort levels (which may also have potential correlation with cyclist safety), a worthwhile goal in itself. As such, these two models may be used in combination when targeting new cycling infrastructure and improvements.},

	abstract = {Presently, the collection and analysis of naturalistic data is the most credited method for understanding road user behavior and improving trafﬁc safety. Such methodology was developed for motorized vehicles, such as cars and trucks, and is still largely applied to those vehicles. However, a reasonable question is whether bicycle safety can also beneﬁt from the naturalistic methodology, once collection and analyses are properly ported from motorized vehicles to bicycles. This paper answers this question by showing that instrumented bicycles can also collect analogous naturalistic data. In addition, this paper shows how naturalistic cycling data from 16 bicyclists can be used to estimate risk while cycling. The results show that cycling near an intersection increased the risk of experiencing a critical event by four times, and by twelve times when the intersection presented some form of visual occlusion (e.g., buildings and hedges). Poor maintenance of the road increased the risk tenfold. Furthermore, the risk of experiencing a critical event was twice as large when at least one pedestrian or another bicyclist crossed the bicyclist’s trajectory. Finally, this study suggests the two most common scenarios for bicycle accidents, which result from different situations and thus require different countermeasures. The ﬁndings presented in this paper show that bicycle safety can beneﬁt from the naturalistic methodology, which provides data able to guide development and evaluation of (intelligent) countermeasures to increase cycling safety.},

The study design accounted for the effects of general safety trends and regression-to-the-mean, but could not take into account the possibility of specific changes in traffic volume at roundabouts. The conversion of intersections into roundabouts produces a significant 27% increase in the number of injury accidents involving bicyclists on or nearby the roundabouts. The increase is even higher for accidents involving fatal or serious injuries (41–46%). Compared to the proven favourable effects of roundabouts on safety in general, this result is unexpectedly poor. However, the effects of roundabouts on bicycle accidents differ depending on whether these roundabouts are built inside or outside built-up areas. When inside built-up areas, the construction of roundabouts increased the number of injury accidents involving bicyclists by 48%. For accidents causing fatal or serious injuries inside built-up areas, an average increase of 77% was found. However, outside built-up areas the zero-hypothesis of ‘no safety effect for bicyclists’ cannot be rejected (best estimate: +1% accidents, not significant). Roundabouts that replace traffic signals perform worse when compared to roundabouts at other types of intersections.},

The tools are based on the equation for bicycle level-of-service in a U.S. government manual. The equation requires substantial data that can be time-intensive and expensive to collect for a wide-scale area. For this reason, the paper begins by discussing data-availability issues with a survey that was sent to every city and county in Idaho. Of the 115 responses, no community had all the necessary data and many had very little data. Next, the paper describes a sensitivity analysis that engineers and planners can follow to identify the critical data that should be collected for their community. The sensitivity analysis is described using two case study communities and reveals, among other things, that input-output sensitivity for bicycle level-of-service depends on roadway functional class. The tools and strategies in this paper will save communities time and money when developing plans or prioritizing projects.

In this study, the hypothesis that bicycling was primarily an urban activity was investigated. Binary logistic regression was used to compare the frequency of bicycling and the population characteristics of bicyclists across urban and RSLD places. Multiple operational definitions of urban–rural continua were used to examine whether the results were sensitive to how RSLD places were defined. The data for bicycling were from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, which was designed to represent the population of the United States. Bicycling was found to be primarily, but not exclusively, an urban activity. Moreover, women and youths were more likely to bicycle in RSLD places compared with urban places. These findings suggest that an urban perspective on bicycling could limit the success of initiatives aiming to increase the diversity of populations that bicycle. Developing a base of empirical knowledge of bicycling in RSLD places is a necessary step toward developing more inclusive and effective multimodal transportation strategies.},

As the popularity of bicycles has increased, so has the physical network of separate bicycle facilities and designated bicycle lanes in many locations. As a consequence of this growth, there is a demand for more information about bicycle operations on these facilities. Unfortunately, the state of knowledge regarding bicycle operations in the United States currently lags far behind that of motor vehicles and pedestrians. The international research that has been conducted to date regarding bicycle operations on uninterrupted facilities is thoroughly reviewed, and recommended procedures for the operational analysis of uninterrupted bicycle facilities are outlined. The recommended procedures are based on the concept of “frequencies of events” involving a bicyclist and other bicyclists or facility users. Events are defined as bicycle maneuvers required by a bicyclist on a facility, including passings (same-direction encounters) and meetings (opposite-direction encounters). The frequency of events for an uninterrupted bicycle facility is related to the service volumes of bicycles using or projected to be using the facility and does not have to be observed directly. The proposed procedures are, therefore, recommended based not only on their theoretical substance but also on their ease of use by practitioners.},

	abstract = {The principal objective of this research is to evaluate the multimodal performance of arterial corridors using currently available multimodal level of service (MMLOS) methodologies. Eight different MMLOS approaches are applied to a case study using an arterial corridor section in Austin, Texas. The methodologies applied are: Highway Capacity Manual; Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual; Charlotte, NC, Urban Street Design Guidelines; pedestrian and bicycle environmental quality indices; assessment of level of traffic stress; bicycle compatibility index; deficiency index; and Walk ScoreÒ, Bike ScoreÒ, and Transit ScoreÒ. The analysis is focused on the assessment of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes. The methodologies are evaluated and contrasted. The paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of practice of multimodal evaluation and recommendations about the most appropriate approaches to assess multimodal performance of arterial corridors.},

The safety and efﬁciency are reduced because of the motor vehicle–bicycle conﬂict under mixed trafﬁc condition that motor vehicles and bicycles use the same road simultaneously. In order to solve the problem, it is necessary to separate motor vehicles from bicycles and to distribute the road resource reasonably between motor vehicles and bicycles. In order to conduct the above work, it is necessary to work on the bicycle conversion factors. The factors are researched under various trafﬁc conditions in the paper. According to trafﬁc characteristics of motor vehicles and bicycles, the conversion factor models are set up for bicycle relevant to pcu (passenger car unit). The bicycle conversion factors are calculated under four situations based on the ﬁeld data collected in Shenyang, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang in China. The through bicycle conversion factor is 0.28 and the left-turn 0.33 at mixed intersections. The bicycle conversion factor in road section is 0.22 with physical separations and 0.24 without physical separations.},

This article uses empirical bicycle route choice data from 467 university students in Trondheim, Norway to test the applicability of BLOS rating schemes for the estimation of whole-journey route choice. The methods evaluated share a common trait of being applicable for mixed traﬃc urban environments: Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI), Bicycle Stress Level (BSL), Sixth Edition Highway Capacity Manual (HCM6), and Level of Traﬃc Stress (LTS). Routes are generated based on BLOS-weighted networks and the suitability of these routes is determined by ﬁnding the percentage overlap with empirical route choices. The results show that BCI provides the best match with empirical route data in all ﬁve origin–destination pairs, followed by HCM6. BSL and LTS which are not empirically founded have a lower match rate, although the diﬀerences between the four methods are relatively small. By iterating the detour rate that cyclists are assumed to be willing to make, it is found that the best match with modelled BLOS routes is achieved between 15 and 21\% additional length. This falls within the range suggested by existing empirical research on willingness to deviate from the shortest path, however, it is uncertain whether the method will deliver the comparable ﬁndings in other cycling environments.},

	abstract = {A bicycle is one of the key modes of transport in small Indian cities, where two-thirds of all trips are made by either bicycle or by walking. Despite having a substantial bicycle share, none of these cities have safe bicycle infrastructures. As a result, bicyclists share the road space with various types of motorized traffic, putting them at higher risk. It is thus necessary to evaluate the quality of bicycle travel from the users’ perspective and develop appropriate mitigation measures. To this end, the main objective of this paper is to develop a tool to evaluate the quality of bicycling at roadway segments with respect to several roadway-related physical and functional characteristics and land use. For the stated purpose, user perception on bicycle suitability was collected using a six-point Likert scale in several homogeneous roadway segments in Kharagpur, a small Indian city. Subsequently, bicyclist perceived level of service (LOS) criteria were developed by formulating Ordered-Probit (OP) models, which can capture the ordered nature of the dependent variable (perceived bicycle LOS of a segment). Results indicated that among the variables measured in continuous scale, on-street parking (ONP) proportion has the strongest influence on bicyclistperceived LOS followed by motorized volume and the 85th percentile speed of motor vehicles. Among the categorical independent variables, both pavement condition score and land-use type influence the bicyclist-perceived LOS significantly. Subsequently, bicyclist-perceived LOS criteria were also applied to assess bicycle suitability of a set of roadway segments in Kharagpur.

	abstract = {Bicycle is widely used in Japan by people of all age groups in daily usage, which may significantly ease traffic congestion. Responding to the cyclists increasing, the method to assess the quality of bicycle travel become necessary. Previous studies reported several approaches to obtain evaluation methods. However, cycleway evaluation in Japan is still far behind the evaluation methods developed in Europe or America. This paper concentrated on familiarizing readers with two methods for evaluating the quality of bicycle facilities and then presenting some proposals of cycleway evaluation in Japan referencing to these two methods. The first method, Bicycle Compatibility Index (BCI), is used to evaluate the road environment for cycling according to the road characteristics by statistical analysis. The second method, Bicycle Level of Service (BLOS), also represents an evaluation of safety for bicyclists. Both of the above methods offered equations of comfort and safety perceptions of bicyclists according to cycling environments. By introducing these methods in combination, this paper enables the readers to maximize the comparative advantages of both BCI and BLOS. The comparison includes sensitivity of variables and the development of both methods. Then we applied BCI and BLOS to evaluate the target roadways in Kumamoto, Japan.},

	abstract = {Research into the bicycle level-of-service (BLOS) has been extensively conducted over the last three decades. This research has mostly focused on user perceptions of comfort to provide guidance for decision-makers and planners. Segments and nodes were studied ﬁrst, followed by a network evaluation. Besides these investigations, several variables have also been utilized to depict the users’ perspectives within the BLOS ﬁeld, along with other cycling research domains that simultaneously scrutinized the users’ preferences. This review investigates the variables and indices employed in the BLOS area in relation to the ﬁeld of bicycle ﬂow and comfort research. Despite general agreement among existing BLOS variables and the adopted indices, several important research gaps remain to be ﬁlled. First, BLOS indices are often categorized based on transport components, while scarce attention has been paid to BLOS studies in trip-end facilities such as bicycle parking facilities. The importance of these facilities has been highlighted instead within research related to comfort. Second, the advantages of separated bike facilities have been proven in many studies; however, scarce research has addressed the challenges associated with them (e.g., the heterogeneity within those facilities due to the presence of electric bikes and electric scooters). This issue is clearly noticeable within the research regarding ﬂow studies. Furthermore, network evaluation (in comparison to segment and node indices) has been studied to a lesser extent, whereas issues such as connectivity can be evaluated mainly through a holistic approach to the system. This study takes one step toward demonstrating the importance of the integration of similar research domains in the BLOS ﬁeld to eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings.},

Therefore, a bicycle level of service model from the user's perspective was developed so that the existing bicycle roads can be evaluated and improved. The purpose of this paper is to develop a bicycle Level of Service (LOS) model by considering the user’s level of satisfaction and multiple factors that affect the bicycle LOS. Bicycle LOS criteria are estimated by applying an ordered probit model, which is suitable for research relating to choice. The results with the marginal effect show that the bicycle LOS is largely determined by the width of the road on which the bicycle is ridden. Other factors are also statistically significant in the bicycle LOS, including the road type, the total number of lanes on the approach to the intersection, and the number of encounters (travelers and bicyclists moving in the opposite direction).},

	abstract = {Since 1965, traffic engineers and planners have used a measurement known as level of service (LOS) to describe the operating conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists, passengers, or both. Although the most recent edition of the publication that defines these standards, the Highway Capacity Manual, does contain a short section on bicycles, it is more concerned with the effects of bicycles on traffic flows within intersections than with the ability of various types of roads and traffic conditions to provide quality of service to cyclists. In the last several years, some researchers and planners interested in bicycling issues have made attempts to develop an index of roadway operational conditions important to bicycle users. Although there have been several different approaches to the problem, recent work has centered on a method based on five descriptive factors: per-lane traffic volume, speed of traffic, right-hand-lane width (including the width of bicycle lanes or road shoulders), overall pavement quality, and the generation of conflicting travel paths. Taken together, these efforts have come close to developing a practical and meaningful roadway LOS standard for bicycle use. Work remains to be done in several areas: the relationship between LOS values and the perception of various cyclists as to the quality of service provided by a roadway, the role of level of service in cyclist route selection, and the applicability of the methodology to bicyclists with different skills and use needs.{\textless}p /{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Language: en{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Gainesville Mobility Plan Prototype was developed as the congestion management system plan for Gainesville, Florida, and incorporated level-of-service (LOS) performance measures for bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The LOS evaluations describe the degree of bicycle and pedestrian accommodation in a transportation corridor. The bicycle LOS measures are designated basic facility provided, conflicts, speed differential, motor vehicle LOS, maintenance, and provision of transportation demand management programs or intermodal links. Pedestrian LOS criteria are similar and incorporate specific pedestrian features. The Gainesville bicycle and pedestrian LOS performance measures use a point scale resulting in an LOS rating system of A through F. The scoring system was developed with sensitivity to characteristics that may be mutually exclusive or inclusive to determine all possible combinations of points. The methodology hypothesizes that there is a critical mass of variables that must be present to attract nonmotorized trips. The methodology is applicable for corridor evaluations on arterial and collector roadways in urban or suburban areas. The criteria include measures of programmatic and off-street projects such as rail-trails, bicycle parking, bikes-on-transit, employer-based programs, and so forth, in addition to traditional on-street facility improvements. By measuring such improvements recommendations for more diverse projects can be supported. This analysis was applied to several roadways with promising results that generally corresponded to user perceptions of the facilities. LOS evaluation was used as a tool of the congestion management system to develop project recommendations and priorities, but it may also be useful in concurrency and long-range transportation planning.},

@article{Botma1995,
abstract = {In the Highway Capacity Manual of 1985, no levels of service (LOSs) for cyclists on separate paths are given. In the framework of the Dutch manual on bicycle infrastructure, a measure of quality of operation was developed: the hindrance that users of the path experience due to their interactions or maneuvers. Simplifying this to the frequency of passing and meeting maneuvers, the well-known LOSs from A to F can be defined. A new point is that LOS F is not merely a congested state of traffic, but is defined as a very poor overall quality of traffic operation. This approach was then extended to traffic operation on separate narrow paths used by pedestrians and bicyclists. Using this method the LOS can be determined separately for pedestrians, bicyclists, and the average user of the path. LOSs are a function of the volume of both types of users. Results appeared consistent, but some key parameters used as an input of the procedure have to be estimated empirically in applying this method. That is, they should be based on investigations of rating of maneuvers in terms of hindrance. The results can be used to determine requirements for path width and criteria for separation of bicycles and pedestrians.},

Projects such as « La Route Verte » were created so that local authorities could develop and improve their bicycle networks. Decisions must increasingly be taken in rural areas concerning the designation of bicycle routes and associated roadside improvements. However, no tool adapted to Quebec conditions has been developed to identify the most compatible routes for cyclists on the road network. This research aims to build a safety and compatibility index for rural and urban fringe areas, using a combination of parameters (ex. speed, traffic, and layout). The resulting CRC Index (Compatibility of Roads for Cyclists) is an innovative tool: it allows the evaluation of both existing and potential routes, and of modifications that may be needed. The index is built on the results of a survey to evaluate a variety of rural sites by cyclists, and to understand their perceptions of comfort and safety relative to different elements of bicycle routes and the characteristics of rural roads. This decision-aid tool should be easy to use both by planners and bicycle coordinators. Also, the CRC Index goes further than previous tools using cartographic analysis to identify the most bicycle-compatible parts of the road network, and can target priority locations for interventions.},

	abstract = {Several methods exist for quantifying the quality of service provided by a roadway from a bicyclist's perspective; however, many of these models do not consider physically protected bike lanes. Of those that do, none was developed on the basis of empirical data from the United States. This gap is problematic because engineers, planners, and elected officials are increasingly looking to objective performance measures to help guide both transportation project design and funding prioritization decisions. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a cumulative logistic model to predict user comfort on protected bike lanes that was developed from data collected during in-person video surveys. The surveys were conducted in Portland, Oregon, with video footage gathered in Portland; Chicago, Illinois; and San Francisco, California. The model is for road segments only and not signalized intersections. It complements the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 level-of-service methods by providing an analysis procedure for a facility type that is not currently included in the manual. The model indicates that the type of buffer, direction of travel (one-way versus two-way), adjacent motor vehicle speed limit, and average daily motor vehicle volumes are all significant predictors of bicyclist comfort in protected bike lanes. The model predicts a mean value of A or B on a scale of A (most comfortable) to F (least comfortable) for all protected bike lane video clips that were used in the survey. Consistent with previous research findings, survey respondents report that protected bike lanes are generally more comfortable than other types of on-street infrastructure.

	abstract = {The built environment has been shown to influence active transportation. Although spatial data for the built environment is increasingly available, there has been little effort to use existing data and knowledge to define and map ‘bikeability’ as an approach to promoting travel by bicycle. Our goal was to build a tool to identify areas that are more conducive and less conducive to cycling. We used empirical research to develop a bikeability index and geographic information systems to map the index across the Metro Vancouver region. Results of an opinion survey, travel behaviour studies, and focus groups were used to identify the components of the index and their relative importance. Pertinent geospatial data layers were scored and combined using a flexible weighting scheme to create a composite map highlighting both high and low bikeability areas. The bikeability index was comprised of five factors shown to consistently influence cycling: bicycle facility availability; bicycle facility quality; street connectivity; topography; and land use. For mapping purposes, we created corresponding metrics: density of bicycle facilities; separation from motor vehicle traffic; connectivity of bicycle-friendly roads (local streets, bicycle routes, and off-street paths); slope; and density of destination locations. Using empirical evidence to combine data layers for these metrics we generated a high-resolution (10 m) bikeability surface for the region, depicting bicycle-friendly areas and areas where cycling conditions need to be improved. Built environment interventions for specific locations are informed by evaluating scores for the five individual component layers. Mapping bikeability provides a powerful visual aid to identify zones where changes are needed to support sustainable travel. This evidence-based tool presents data in a userfriendly way for planners and policy makers. The overall bikeability score and its five component scores can guide local action to stimulate changes in cycling rates. It uses widely available data types, thus facilitating easy application in other cities. Furthermore, the flexible parameters and weighting scheme enable users elsewhere to tailor it to evidence about local preferences and conditions.},

abstract = {A novel method assessed the quality of bicycle travel throughout a community. Most previous research on the quality of bicycle travel assessed bicycle suitability, that is, the perceived comfort and safety of a linear section of bikeway. Assessment of bikeability (as defined by authors), however, considers comfort and safety of the entire bikeway network for access to important destinations, and there is ample research concerning the related concept of accessibility. A proposed calculation for bikeability was developed on the basis of a common accessibility equation and was demonstrated through a case study of three capital investment scenarios. The analysis used a geographic information system. Engineers and planners can follow a similar procedure to the one used in the calculation development to prioritize improvement projects or to communicate the benefits of new projects.},

@article{dillCyclistTypes,
abstract = { To understand the makeup of a population in terms of how people view bicycling can help in planning bicycle facilities and programs. Roger Geller, bicycle coordinator for the City of Portland, Oregon, proposed a typology that characterized people as one of four types—strong and fearless, enthused and confident, interested but concerned, and no way, no how—with respect to their attitudes toward bicycling. The research presented here sought to find out how applicable the typology was nationally and explored motivating factors, barriers, and the appeal of various bicycle facility types for each type of cyclist or potential cyclist. This study followed up on an earlier study that tested Geller's typology with Portland data. In this new study, a sample involved 3,000 adults who lived in the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. On the basis of respondents' (a) stated level of comfort when they bicycled in different environments, (b) their interest in bicycling, and (c) their recent behavior, the study estimated that about one-third of adults were in the no way, no how group, and about half were in the interested but concerned group. The distribution was similar to that of the earlier findings for Portland. Several demographic differences emerged, with women less likely to be enthusiastic and confident or to be interested but concerned. Few differences appeared in whether respondents had ridden a bike at all in the past 30 days. Differences emerged as to where they bicycled and how often. The interested but concerned group was least likely to ride for transportation and rode less frequently. Barriers included not having a bicycle to ride; needing a vehicle for work, school, or other reasons; destinations too far to reach by bicycle; too few bike lanes or trails; and traffic. },

abstract = { Following global guidelines, several cities are investing in urban cycling. Cities are in different stages of cycling development and have adopted different approaches and packages of policies that are likely to be most effective at each stage. Urban cycling plans include investment in infrastructure, promotion, and education supporting the adoption of active modes for urban mobility. Some investments aim to meet current cyclists’ needs and others those of potential bicycle adopters. With respect to urban cyclists, several studies propose typologies, usually related to frequency, trip purpose, or motivation. This paper compares a set of cyclist typologies and the corresponding categorization methods and reviews 20 studies that considered different cyclists’ profiles. Most studies relied on expert judgment approaches or rule-based decisions; five considered multivariate analysis techniques for clustering groups, on the basis of data from surveys. Despite the variety of group categorizations, commonalities were found in most cases and divided cyclists into three main types: current cyclists (typically more proficient riders), potential cyclists (willing but not convinced), and noncyclists (unaware of or unwilling to shift to cycling). Dividing the population of potential cyclists into different typologies can better inform the different stages of planning for cycling infrastructure development by targeting more accurately the needs and requirements of different types of users. This is a key element in the management of a cycling network and cycling infrastructure, which are intended to be built on the basis of effective solutions and decisions to achieve desirable bicycle modal shares of regular trips. }

abstract = {Two-lane rural roads in Spain accommodate significant bicycle traffic volumes, mainly associated to sport and leisure activities. Motor vehicles’ higher speed, weight and volume, compared to cyclists, represent a serious safety concern when overtaking a bicycle. Spanish traffic rules determine a minimum 1.5m lateral distance. This research characterised 2928 overtaking manoeuvres in the overtaking lateral clearance between motor vehicle and bicycle, as well as in the motor vehicle speed, in contrast with previous research. Two instrumented bicycles were equipped with laser rangefinders, a GPS tracker and three video cameras. They rode along seven rural road segments at a speed between 15 and 25km/h, centred on the paved shoulder, or as close as possible to the outer edge. Besides, this methodology allowed the characterisation of the overtaken vehicle type, its left lane occupation as well as its interaction with opposing traffic flow. For each session, rider’s general risk perception was also registered. The analysis suggested that lateral clearance is not the only factor that influenced rider’s risk perception, although current standards are only related to it. On the contrary, a combined factor of lateral clearance, vehicle type and vehicle speed had a more significant correlation with the perceived risk. This agreed with literature models of transient aerodynamic forces between overtaking and overtaken vehicles. Results showed that effect of heavy vehicles on bicyclists was also strong. In addition to this, the combined factor of clearance and speed was higher on tangent sections where overtaking was permitted.}

abstract = {Drivers overtaking cyclists on rural roads are a safety concern, as drivers need to handle the interaction with the cyclist and possibly an oncoming vehicle. Improving the maneuver’s outcome requires an understanding of not only the objective, measurable safety metrics, but also the subjective, perceived safety of each road user. Previous research has shown that the perceived safety of the cyclist is most at risk at the passing moment, when driver and cyclist are closest to each other. However, to develop safety measures, it is necessary to know how both road users perceive safety, by understanding the factors that influence their perceptions during the overtaking maneuver. This study measured the perceived safety of drivers in a test-track experiment in Sweden and the perceived safety of cyclists in a field test in Spain. For both drivers and cyclists, we developed Bayesian ordinal logistic regression models of perceived safety scores that take as input objective safety metrics representing the different crash risks at the passing moment. Our results show that while drivers’ perceived safety decreases when there is an oncoming vehicle with a low time-to-collision, cyclists’ perceived safety is reduced by a small lateral clearance and a high overtaking speed. Although our datasets are heterogeneous and limited, our results are in line with previous research. In addition, the Bayesian models presented in this paper are novel and may be improved in future studies once more naturalistic data become available. We discuss how our models may support infrastructure development and regulation, policymaking, driver coaching, the development of active safety systems, and automated driving by providing a possible method for predicting perceived safety.}
