abstract  ="Transportation engineers have used editions of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) in their analyses for decades. The HCM is the fundamental reference for concepts, performance measures, and analysis techniques for evaluating the multimodal operation of streets, highways, freeways, and off-street paths. This 7th Edition contains new information, including new planning-level methods for connected and automated vehicles; a completely revised procedure for analyzing two-lane highways; a new procedure for evaluating systems of freeways and arterials with queue spillback; and updated methodologies for pedestrian operations at uncontrolled and signalized crossings.",

abstract  ={TRB's National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 825: Planning and Preliminary Engineering Applications Guide to the Highway Capacity Manual will help planners apply the methodologies of the 6th Edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) to common planning and preliminary engineering analyses, including scenario planning and system performance monitoring. It shows how the HCM can interact with travel demand forecasting, mobile source emission, and simulation models and its application to multimodal analyses and oversaturated conditions. Three case studies (freeway master plan, arterial bus rapid transit analysis, and long-range transportation plan analysis) illustrate the techniques presented in the guide. In addition to providing a cost-effective and reliable approach to analysis, the guide provides a practical introduction to the detailed methodologies of the HCM.The guide is supplemented by a PowerPoint presentation that describes the purpose and scope of NCHRP Report 825, and includes descriptions of the three case studies.},

abstract = { Acceleration characteristics of passenger cars starting from rest are often used in traffic simulation, modeling of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions, and design of intersections, acceleration lanes for entrance terminals, turning bays, and passing lanes. Most of the previous studies developed four different acceleration models: the constant acceleration model, the two-phase model, the linear-decreasing acceleration model, and the polynomial acceleration model. However, most of the studies were based on outdated and limited data, so their conclusions may not be applicable for the current vehicle fleet and drivers. The normal acceleration behavior of current passenger vehicles starting from rest at all-way stop-controlled intersections is evaluated, and the previous acceleration models are verified with recent observations. A comparison is included between the acceleration behaviors of straight and turning maneuvers and the influence of speed limits on acceleration rates, and two new polynomial models are developed for driver acceleration behavior for turning maneuvers versus straight maneuver acceleration from a stopped condition. }
