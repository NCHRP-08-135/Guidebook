abstract = { The intersection control-type selections for future facilities can be determined by comparison of a common measure of effectiveness that is average control delay. However, rigid comparisons of such measures tend to mislead the decision-making process in practice, since there must be latent factors in quantification. To this end, this paper proposes the performance comparison framework of different transportation facility alternatives using a common quantitative measure. By considering the uncertainties in a quantification process, the proposed framework provides gray areas (i.e.,\&nbsp;intuitively visualized information, which decision-makers can use to assist in their engineering decisions). The average control delay of two-way stop control, all-way stop control, signal control types, and roundabouts were compared with contour lines of delay differences. It is found that the delay of a roundabout increases rapidly as the traffic demand increases. Hence, a signal control type has the minimum delay level in that case, despite the fact that the roundabout outperforms for most of the low-demand conditions. When the signal timing plan is optimized, this feature becomes evident. With consideration of the margin of error in the delay, a gray area on the minimum delay surface between the signal control and roundabout types enlarges in the low-demand area. The gray areas can be utilized by practitioners to decide the best intersection control type with consideration of construction and maintenance costs over delay reduction benefit. }

abstract = { In urban road networks, intersections are the main bottlenecks. Selecting an appropriate intersection control type can significantly improve the performance of an isolated intersection. Therefore, this paper offers recommendations for selecting the most efficient control type among two-way stop control, signalized intersection (SIG), roundabout (RB), and signalized roundabout (SIGRB) based on capacity and delay. The procedure to calculate delay and capacity is taken from the Highway Capacity Manual 6th edition (2016), or developed separately if needed. Two flow patterns are assumed: fixed and time-varying demand. For fixed demand, the results show that SIGRB outperforms other control types both in capacity and delay at higher demand levels. It was also observed that increase in left-turn ratio increases the delay and decreases the capacity of all control types while its impact on SIGRB was the least. Considering time-varying demand, traffic volume fluctuates over the 5-h period of the analysis. It was found that using both RB and SIGRB together creates significantly less delay compared with the other options. Additionally, using RB provides less variability in delay when there is fluctuation in demand. The major finding of this research is that RB and SIGRB have potential benefits for delay in conditions of (i) high traffic volume, (ii) high left-turn ratio, and (iii) demand fluctuation. Furthermore, it is suggested that SIG should be used if the left-turn ratio is relatively low. The results of this study could help decision-makers to choose the best control type for an isolated intersection under various traffic conditions. }

DOI={10.7307/ptt.v21i3.221},
abstractNote={Delays belong to standard parameters used for the evaluation of any type of intersection and they are taken in the evaluation of the level of service of an intersection. Intersections with shorter delays bring about economical benefits both for the users and the community, and enable greater efficiency of a traffic system, which is becoming a significant criterion with the increasing motorization. The case studies carried out in Europe and worldwide reveal that roundabouts bring delay savings if compared with other intersections of the same operational level and nearly the same traffic volume. The paper shows the results of the comparison analysis of the roundabout and the signal-controlled intersection in the city of Osijek, Croatia. The statistical indicators have given the basis for the evaluation of delays at the observed intersections, offering at the same time the possibility to compare the analysis conclusions on the local level with the conclusions of the case studies carried out throughout Europe and worldwide.

abstract = { Roundabouts are becoming increasingly popular in the United States and have been considered for use at intersections facing operational or safety problems. A comparative analysis was performed on all-way stop-controlled (AWSC) intersections and roundabouts on the basis of aaSIDRA software after calibration against local conditions in Delaware and Maryland. A decision support system was developed in the form of a knowledge-based expert system on the basis of the results of the analysis to evaluate the performance of AWSC intersections and their potential success if converted into roundabouts. The results of the comparative analysis are in line with some previous researchers’ findings that AWSC intersections always perform worse than signal-controlled or roundabout type intersections under the same set of traffic conditions and geometric limitations. }

abstract = { The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) displayed the figure Exhibit 10-15 for the purpose of forecasting the likely intersection control types for future facilities. Because this figure is from a source external to HCM, to verify it, this paper employs HCM methodologies for the estimation and comparison of control delay, the choice measure of effectiveness at intersections controlled by signal, all-way stop signs, and two-way stop signs. After detailed analyses of more than 5,000 cases using Highway Capacity Software, results of control delay with various control types under a wide range of demand conditions were charted for comparison with Exhibit 10-15. It is found that Exhibit 10-15 is inconsistent with the results from HCM methodologies and, perhaps, should be replaced with the figures developed in this paper. On the basis of the criterion of minimizing delay alone, it is found that if demand is unbalanced between major and minor streets and if the traffic is low on minor streets, two-way-stop control should be used; if demand is somewhat balanced and minor streets see low to medium traffic, all-way-stop control is preferred; otherwise, signal control should be favored. The paper also demonstrates that the percentage of left-turning traffic has a significant effect on decisions involving intersection control types. }

abstract = { Speed can increase the risk of injury-producing crashes, especially at intersections where vehicles may be approaching and entering the intersection with high speed differentials. It is known that roundabouts force all drivers to reduce their speed in the intersection; however, speed data in advance of the roundabout approach were not available for roundabouts with high-speed approaches to verify this phenomenon. In this research, a comparative evaluation of the difference in the average approach speeds between rural roundabouts and rural two-way-stop-controlled intersections and between rural roundabouts with and without rumble strips on the intersection approaches was performed. Approach speed data proved that drivers could slow down in advance of roundabouts on rural roadways. The mean speed 100 ft from the yield line of the roundabouts was 2.5 mph lower than the mean speed 100 ft from the stop bar at stop-controlled approaches. Additionally, a comparison of roundabout approaches with and without rumble strips showed mean speeds 4.3 and 3.3 mph lower 100 and 250 ft from the yield line, respectively, for approaches with rumble strips; however, the variation in speeds increased with the introduction of rumble strips. }
